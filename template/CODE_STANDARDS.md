# Rust Coding Standards for Macroquad Games

**Engine**: Macroquad + macroquad-toolkit  
**Language**: Rust  
**Platform**: WebGL (WASM) + Native

This document defines the centrally maintained coding standards for Macroquad game projects. Keep project-local copies identical to the canonical `docs/CODE_STANDARDS.md`; put project-specific guidance in the project's README or another local documentation file instead.

## 1. Core Philosophy

### 1.1 Write for Maintainability
Prefer obvious, readable code with no hidden state or side effects.

### 1.2 Consistency Beats Preference
Match established patterns and avoid unrelated refactors. Add dependencies only
when they remove real complexity or match an established project pattern. Keep
gameplay deterministic where practical; isolate randomness in small helpers or
state-owned RNG.

### 1.3 Data-Driven Design
Keep game content and configuration in JSON; see section 5.3.

### 1.4 No Unused Code
Delete unused variables, fields, and functions; never hide them with `_` prefixes.
Unused parameters may use `_` only when a required trait/API signature prevents removal.

## 2. Project Structure Rules

### 2.1 Module Responsibilities
Each module owns one domain: `main.rs` coordinates the loop and transitions;
`data/` owns schemas/loading; `engine/` owns calculations, entity/state-machine
services and effects; `state/` owns current/persistent state and save/load;
`ui/` owns toolkit-based views/widgets; optional `screens/` owns screen rendering.
Data types know neither engine nor UI. State ownership and UI actions follow
sections 5.1 and 7.

### 2.2 File Size Guideline
- Target 200–400 lines per file; begin planning a split at 600.
- Every `.rs` file has a hard limit of 800 total physical lines, including whitespace, comments, attributes, and tests. Implementation, test, generated source, example, build-script, and bench files have no exemptions.
- Extract a cohesive responsibility before a change exceeds the limit. Restructure any existing oversized file encountered during the task before completing it.
- Never meet the limit by stripping spacing, compressing formatting, or moving a single small function solely to reduce the count.
- Use the source gate described in `MACROQUAD_TOOLKIT.md`; exception lists must be empty.

### 2.3 Module Source Filenames
- Use Rust's named module source filenames: `foo.rs` for `mod foo;`, and `foo/bar.rs` for `mod bar;` inside `foo.rs`.
- Do not create new `mod.rs` files.
- When restructuring existing modules, prefer migrating `foo/mod.rs` to `foo.rs` and keeping child modules under `foo/`.
- Do not keep both `foo.rs` and `foo/mod.rs`; Rust treats that as an ambiguous module source.

### 2.4 Folder Structure

Use `src/main.rs` plus `src/lib.rs` for logic shared by binary and tests;
`src/data.rs`, `engine.rs`, `state.rs`, and `ui.rs` are named module roots with
children under matching directories. Keep tests beside `Cargo.toml` in `tests/`
and JSON content under `assets/` (for example `constants.json`, `localization/`).
The working template demonstrates the layout; follow existing project structure.

## 3. Naming Conventions

### 3.1 General Rules
- Types: PascalCase  
- Functions & variables: snake_case  
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE  
- Modules: snake_case  

Names should describe what the thing is, not how it works.

### 3.2 Boolean Naming
Booleans should read like facts:  
```rust
is_active  
can_interact  
has_unlocked  
should_update  
```  
Avoid `flag`, `value`, or `state` in names.

### 3.3 Service Naming
Engine services follow a naming pattern:
- `*Service` for stateless helpers
- `*Engine` for complex stateless processors
- `*StateMachine` for state progressions

## 4. Functions & Methods

### 4.1 Function Size
- Target: 20–50 lines  
- Absolute max: 100 lines  
- If a function needs scrolling, it probably needs refactoring.

### 4.2 Single Responsibility
Each function should answer one question or perform one action.

### 4.3 Argument Count
- Prefer ≤ 3 parameters  
- If more are needed, use a struct or reference to state  
- Services should take `&GameState` or `&Config` rather than many individual fields

### 4.4 Return Types
- Use `Option<T>` for potentially missing values  
- Use custom result structs for complex outcomes
- Avoid returning multiple values via tuple; create a named struct instead

## 5. Data & State Management

### 5.1 Game State Ownership
- `GameState` owns current state; `PlayerStats` owns persistent progression.
- `Game` coordinates state mutations through explicit actions and transitions; action handlers may live in dedicated modules.
- Engine services receive state and return results rather than owning mutable state.
- UI reads state and returns intents for the dispatcher to apply (§7).

### 5.2 Prefer Plain Data
Use structs with clear fields. Avoid overly clever enums with embedded logic unless they model a real state machine.  

Game data should be:  
- Serializable (Serde-friendly for save/load)  
- Easy to debug and inspect  
- Immutable after loading from JSON  

### 5.3 Data-Driven Design
- Store game constants, balance, configuration, content, and player-facing text as JSON under `assets/`; reference loaded values rather than hardcoding them.
- Load at startup through `macroquad_toolkit::include_json!` for embedded data or typed `macroquad_toolkit::data_loader` functions for runtime/native loading.
- Projects own Serde-backed schemas and semantic validation: IDs, references, balance invariants, and game rules.
- The toolkit owns generic parsing, file loading, platform branching, source-labeled diagnostics, and fallback behavior. Do not create generic project-local loader wrappers or call `serde_json::from_str` directly for game-data files.

### 5.4 Enums for Game Phases
Use enums for real phases, e.g. loading, menu, playing, paused, and game over.
Only one phase is active; transitions are explicit, with no magic callbacks or
shared mutable globals. `Game` calls the active state's update/draw and applies
returned transitions.

## 6. Error Handling

### 6.1 Prefer Option Over Panics
- `panic!` is acceptable only for truly unrecoverable states  
- Missing entities or items should return `None`, not panic  
- Use:  
  - `Option<T>` for potentially missing values  
  - `Result<T, E>` for fallible I/O operations (save/load)  
  - Graceful degradation for missing data  

### 6.2 Logging Over Silent Failures
Use `eprintln!` for error conditions that should be visible during development but shouldn't crash the game.

## 7. UI Code (Macroquad-Toolkit)

Read [UI_STYLE.md](UI_STYLE.md) before designing or changing a screen. It defines
the required screen brief, visual hierarchy, progressive disclosure, template
adaptation, and visual review. The rules below govern implementation.

### 7.1 UI Is Dumb
UI reads state and returns actions; it never contains game logic or mutates state.

### 7.2 Action Pattern
Components return `Option<UiAction>` (e.g. start, pause, resume) for the dispatcher
to apply. Add an intent rather than reaching into state from a panel.

### 7.3 Component Organization
- `core.rs` – Color schemes, fonts, base styling  
- `components.rs` – Reusable widgets  
- Each component is a pure function: `fn draw_thing(state: &State) -> Option<UiAction>`

### 7.4 Macroquad-Toolkit Usage
Use shared toolkit widgets, input helpers, and palettes. Prefer buttons that fire on release; use press actions only when immediate feedback is intentional. See `MACROQUAD_TOOLKIT.md` for imports, API examples, and button semantics.

### 7.5 Browser Controls and Layout
- Games are touch-first: starting, tutorials, core interactions, and recovery must work through visible tap/click controls without a physical keyboard.
- Keyboard shortcuts may supplement controls. Player-facing shortcut text must also name the equivalent visible touch control.
- Tutorial prompts name the exact visible control or gesture needed next, such as “Tap CONTINUE” or “Drag the map.”
- Dismiss completed tutorial prompts and keep help reopenable; preserve visible, understandable controls during normal play (`UI_STYLE.md` §5).
- Keep drawing separate from mutation. Support common desktop browser sizes and responsive scaling; use fixed positions only with an intentional virtual resolution.

## 8. Deployment & Web Standards

### 8.1 Required Files
Every game must have these files for deployment:
- `publish.ps1` – Build and deploy script
- `game_page.json` – Per-game metadata used to generate the WebGL host page
- `catalog_thumbnail.png` – Root-level catalog image

### 8.2 Build Targets
Use the shared `..\rust_management\cargo.ps1` launcher for concurrent local builds, checks, tests and Clippy. It leases a bounded shared build slot and uses sccache when installed; it does not copy source or change workspace membership. Publishing and capture integrate it automatically. See `rust_management/docs/CARGO_WORKSPACE.md`.

The game must build for:
- **Windows**: `..\rust_management\cargo.ps1 build --release`
- **Web/WASM**: `..\rust_management\cargo.ps1 build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`

### 8.3 Validation

Validate proportionately for a prototype; commit each coherent, buildable slice promptly.

- **Every Rust slice:** review the full/staged diff; check formatting, strict Clippy (`--all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`), source-size gates, and focused existing tests for changed behavior in the affected crate(s); do not write new ones by default (§11). Fix errors and warnings; do not suppress them or disable checks to pass. If no behavioral test applies (for example a visual-only change), explain the relevant build/manual evidence instead of adding redundant tests.
- **Broader checks when justified:** use integration tests or the full affected-project/member suite for cross-cutting state, simulation, shared API/platform changes, a meaningful integration boundary, or release acceptance. State the risk/trigger; a full suite is not required for every slice. Reuse valid results for unchanged code/configuration/dependencies; rerun affected checks after relevant changes or unresolved failures. Avoid running focused tests immediately before a full suite containing them unless useful for diagnosis.
- **Changed UI only:** inspect affected screens/states and exercise affected interactions. Check normal/minimum sizes where layout, scaling, or input may change, and relevant dense/failure states. Do not refresh or review unrelated screens. See [UI_STYLE.md](UI_STYLE.md#9-review-by-subtraction-then-verify-in-play).
- **Publishing:** never gate a local code-slice commit on `publish.ps1`. Use pooled local builds and relevant hidden captures/browser checks; build WASM when browser/platform behavior or release acceptance needs it. Publishing is separate and may deploy or contact external services: run it only when authorized by the user. Report deliberately unrun deployment without treating it as a local validation failure.
- **Documentation only:** review content/links/commands, run `git diff --check` and relevant sync/documentation-tool checks. No game suites, builds, captures, or publication solely for prose; executable tooling changes need their relevant checks.
- **Failures:** investigate and fix errors, normally in recent/current changes. Distinguish regressions, verified pre-existing failures, and unrun checks with exact commands. Never assume a failure is baseline, hide it, or count it as a pass. If a required check remains blocked outside scope, report it; honor an existing explicit user exception or obtain one before treating the blocked slice as validated. Never commit newly broken code for cadence.

Run checks against the actual checkout and real dependencies. Never bypass failures
with copied projects, alternate manifests, fabricated workspaces, detachment, or
dependency-path changes. Fix the cause within scope and rerun there.

Demo saves do not have to remain backward compatible. An old/unsupported save
must produce a clear, recoverable error and let the player start fresh, not crash.
Implement migration/backward compatibility only when the user explicitly requires
it. There is no blanket migration or determinism test mandate; select checks for
the behavior/risk changed. Write no new tests by default, and delete tests that
assert discarded experimental behaviour (§11); do not delete useful tests merely
to reduce runtime.

Use project-local asset paths and report missing assets/loading failures clearly.

### 8.4 WebGL Requirements
The publisher generates `dist/webgl/index.html` from
`rust_management/web/index.template.html` and the game's `game_page.json`.
Do not maintain a project-root `index.html` for a migrated game. Configure the
title, WASM name, controls, page copy, canvas behavior, and Project Roost slug
in `game_page.json`; change the shared template only for catalog-wide behavior.

### 8.5 Catalog Thumbnail
Each published game should keep `catalog_thumbnail.png` in the project root. Use a 16:9 title-screen or main-menu capture. The shared publisher deploys the file as `<game_slug>/catalog_thumbnail.png`, and the WebHatchery games catalog uses that stable path for card thumbnails.

## 9. Comments & Documentation

### 9.1 Comment Why, Not What
Code already explains what it does. Comments should explain why it exists.

### 9.2 Module-Level Docs
Each module should contain a short `//!` comment explaining its purpose:
```rust
//! Player inventory and item effects.
```

## 10. Formatting & Tooling

### 10.1 rustfmt
- Always use `cargo fmt`  
- Never fight the formatter  

### 10.2 Clippy
- Use strict Clippy (`--all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`) for Rust slices.
- Fix warnings/errors; do not weaken flags or add lint suppressions to pass.
- Existing intentional `#[allow]` attributes need explanatory comments; do not expand them to hide new problems.

### 10.3 Variable Shadowing
- Avoid variable shadowing (hiding)
- Do not declare a new variable with the same name as an existing one in the same scope

## 11. Testing Policy

These games are prototypes in active development. Rapid iteration, experimentation, and playable functionality come first. Testing supports development; it does not dictate design.

### 11.1 Default: No New Tests
- Do not write unit, integration, snapshot, or end-to-end tests by default, including for new features, bug fixes, and refactors.
- Do not add coverage targets, testing frameworks, test-only dependencies, or public API that exists only so a test can reach it, unless the user explicitly asks.
- Validate changes by compiling, running, and exercising the affected feature instead (§11.5).

### 11.2 When a Test Earns Its Place
A test is justified only where it gives clear, lasting value:
- **Stable, complex algorithms** whose design has settled, such as pathfinding, procedural generation, or simulation math.
- **Data integrity**, such as JSON content loading with resolvable cross-references, save/load round-trips, and asset registry coverage.
- **Recurring regressions**: a bug that has come back, not one fixed once.

State the reason in the commit body. Keep each suite small: no more than five `#[test]` cases per protected responsibility, using table-driven assertions for related inputs.

The source-size gate (`tests/code_standards.rs`, §2.2) and the asset-registry integrity test are enforcement gates, not behaviour tests. Every crate keeps them.

### 11.3 What Not to Test
- UI layout, rendering, widget geometry, colours, and copy.
- Experimental gameplay rules and temporary balancing, including tunable values in `assets/*.json`.
- Implementation details: private helpers, internal struct shapes, call order, and state or screen wiring that running the game exercises.

### 11.4 Existing Tests
- Do not preserve behaviour solely because a test asserts it.
- When you deliberately change experimental behaviour, delete the tests that asserted the old behaviour rather than rewriting them to protect a discarded design. Update a test only when it still covers a §11.2 concern.
- A failing test means either your change broke a real invariant (fix the code) or the test encodes an obsolete decision (delete it). Never weaken an assertion just to make it pass.
- While working in an area, remove its tests that §11.3 rules out. Leave unrelated suites for a separate change.

### 11.5 Validation Instead of Tests
- Run the slice checks in §8.3: formatting, strict Clippy, source-size gates, and the existing tests that cover the changed behaviour.
- Exercise the change for real: run the game, and for UI changes capture and review the affected screens (§12, `UI_STYLE.md` §9). Publishing stays separate and needs user authorization (§8.3).
- Do not replace validation with assumptions. Report what was verified and what was not, for example: "captured the market screen and bought two items; did not play through a full season."

### 11.6 Approaching Release
When the user says a project is approaching release, reassess testing against its actual risks, such as save corruption, progression blockers, and data loss, and agree on any added coverage with the user. Until then, this policy applies.

### 11.7 Test Placement
- Each crate owns a `tests/` directory beside its `Cargo.toml`, including member crates in multi-crate repositories. Keep all tests and test-only helpers there.
- Do not add `#[cfg(test)]`, `mod tests`, test helpers, or test source files under `src/`.
- Tests exercise the crate's public API. For a binary-only game, expose logic through `src/lib.rs` and have `main.rs` use that library; keep internals private unless an intentional public seam is needed.
- Existing `src/**/tests.rs` files and inline `mod tests` are legacy. Delete the cases this policy rules out when you work in that area; migrate any that remain to `tests/` as a separate change.
- Split a large retained suite by responsibility while respecting the file-size rule (§2.2).

## 12. Verification Artifacts

- For UI changes, follow `UI_STYLE.md` §9 for affected screens/states and interactions only; check relevant sizes and dense states. Do not recapture unrelated screens. Compilation and geometry checks alone do not verify usability.
- Store verification screenshots directly in `docs/verification/`.
- Do not create screenshot subfolders under `docs/verification/`.
- If a new capture represents the same screen or state as an existing screenshot, replace the existing image instead of keeping duplicates.
- Do not create disposable review files, scratch projects, backup screenshots, or cleanup folders, either inside the workspace or elsewhere. Do not move files out of a repository to make Git status clean. Preserve existing work and report blockers instead.
- Use the shared capture wrapper, retain its hidden-window default, wait for completion, and verify the launched game exits. Fix/report tool failures; do not invent another capture pipeline.
- Investigate ownership/contents of unexpected directories; remove only verified disposable artifacts created by this task within scope, otherwise report a blocker.
- Use existing tooling and direct command output. Established tools may manage their own internal capture manifests, logs, and normal build outputs; do not create an ad hoc parallel set of temporary artifacts.
- Never fabricate a `Cargo.toml`, source file, or placeholder crate to bypass a workspace failure. A missing manifest in an unexpected directory is a workspace hygiene problem to investigate and report, not a request to invent a project.

Correct capture workflow (from the game directory):

```powershell
# Capture required evidence directly to its stable, documented location.
# Use scene names supported by this game; the wrapper is hidden by default.
& ..\macroquad-toolkit\scripts\capture_ui.ps1 -Scenes gameplay -OutputDir docs\verification
# Wait for completion and check the exit result before inspecting the image.
if (-not $?) { throw 'Capture failed; investigate the reported error.' }
# Re-capture to the same filename when iterating; do not create backup copies.
# If workspace discovery fails, inspect/report the offending directory.
# Never create a dummy Cargo.toml or move files into a sibling cleanup folder.
```
